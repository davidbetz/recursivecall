# RecursiveCall (NodeJS)

## Description

Simple API that calls another instance of itself.

This is not the primary nor the most feature rich version. This version exists to demonstrate orchestration (Swarm + Kubernetes) upgrading.

The primary version is [RecursiveCall-Go](https://github.com/davidbetz/recursivecall-go).
